Extended On-Site Computing Guide
================================

The guides contained here aim to extend the current computing guide with other
common tasks that users may be unfamiliar with.
In particular, comiling and installing application and libraries from source,
and installing third-party Python and LaTeX packages.

They are intended as something of a last resort, and in general it is often
better to submit a helpdesk ticket.
A great many libraries, applications, and Python and LaTeX packages have
already been added to your Linux distro's package manager, and installing via
the package manager (probably `aptitude`) is then preferred.
But that requires a helpdesk ticket.
All guides here install into userspace, so you should have no problems despite
your limited user privilages.

Disclaimer: These guides are intended for a specific site distribution, and not
as a general guide.
As noted above, there are generally better ways of achieving these same goals.
If you manage your own system, or you come across this without having been
explicitly pointed towards it, I strongly recommend that you __do not__ follow
the steps contained within!
(With the exception of Python, which follows a pretty standard procedure for
installing to a user-owned directory, if you have cause to do that.)
